## Commands, events, and components structure

This Discord bot template uses CommonJS modules. You cannot use `import`, `export` or any related keywords from the ES6 modules. 

### Prefix commands:
```ts
module.exports = {
    structure: {
        name: string,
        description: string,
        aliases: string[],
        permissions?: PermissionResolvable,
        cooldown?: number,
        developers?: boolean,
        nsfw?: boolean
    },
    run: (client, message, args) => void
};
```

### Slash/User/Message context commands:
```ts
module.exports = {
    structure: SlashCommandBuilder | ContextMenuCommandBuilder,
    options?: {
        cooldown?: number,
        developers?: boolean,
        nsfw?: boolean
    },
    run: (client, interaction) => void
};
```

### Event listener:

The `...args` is a spread operator of arguments from the event chosen. For an example, if the event is **'messageCreate'**, the first argument is going to be type of **Message**.

```ts
module.exports = {
    event: string,
    once?: boolean,
    run: (client, ...args) => void
};
```

### Component:

The `interaction` is the interaction of the component. For an example, if the custom ID is from a button, the interaction is type of ButtonInteraction.

```ts
module.exports = {
    customId: string,
    options?: {
        public?: boolean
    },
    run: async (client, interaction) => Promise<void>
};
```

## Requirements
### Packages:
- **chalk** v2.4.2
- **discord.js** v^14.13.0
- **dotenv** v^latest
- **mongoose** v^latest

> **Warning**
> Installing any version from the package `chalk` that is over **v2.4.2**, it will throw an error that you must enable ES6 modules, while this handler uses CommonJS modules.

### Platforms:
- **Node.js** v16.9.0 or newer

## Setup
1. Install Visual Studio Code.
2. Download this project as a **.zip** file: [Click here](https://github.com/TFAGaming/DiscordJS-V14-Bot-Template/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
3. Extract the .zip file into a normal folder.
4. Open VSCode, click on **Open Folder**, and select the new created folder.
5. Go to `src/` and rename `example.config.js` to `config.js` and fill all the required values.

```ts
module.exports = {
    client: {
        token: string, // ← Your bot token (USE .env IS RECOMMENDED)
        id: string // ← Your bot ID (USE .env IS RECOMMENDED)
    },
    handler: {
        prefix: string, // ← The bot prefix
        deploy: boolean, // ← Always load application commands to Discord? (true: Yes, false: No)
        commands: {
            prefix: boolean, // ← Toggle prefix commands
            slash: boolean, // ← Toggle slash commands
            user: boolean, // ← Toggle user commands
            message: boolean // ← Toggle message commands
        },
        mongodb: {
            uri: string, // ← Your MongoDB URI string (USE .env IS RECOMMENDED)
            toggle: boolean // ← Connect to the database or not? (true: Yes, false: No)
        }
    },
    development: { 
        enabled: boolean, // ← Toggle development mode, if set to true, commands will ONLY deploy to the guild specified below, or GUILD_ID in .env
        guild: string, // ← Your guild ID (USE .env IS RECOMMENDED)
    }, 
    messageSettings: {
        nsfwMessage: string, // ← If the command's channel is not NSFW
        developerMessage: string, // ← If the author of the command isn't a developer
        cooldownMessage: string, // ← If the author of the command has cooldown
        notHasPermissionMessage: string, // ← If the author of the command doesn't have required permissions
        missingDevIDsMessage: string // ← If the developers IDs from the array are missing.
    }
}
```

You can use ENV instead of `config.js` to keep your bot token and ID and your MongoDB URI in a safe place. Rename the file `.env.example` to `.env` and fill all the required values.

```apache
CLIENT_TOKEN = "Your bot token"
CLIENT_ID = "Your bot ID"
GUILD_ID = "Your guild ID"
MONGODB_URI = "Your mongodb URI string"
```

> **Important**
> Do not share any of your project's secrets, such as passwords or tokens to anybody else. If you don't follow this note, this will allow any attackers to manipulate your project without asking your permissions.

6. Initialize a new npm package:

```
npm init
```

7. Install all [required packages](#packages):

```
npm install chalk@2.4.2 discord.js dotenv mongoose
```

8. To start your bot, run `node .` or `npm run start`.
9. Enjoy. =)

## Hosting (<img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1111644651036876822/1124045180484472882/discloud_white_horizon-e96efbfa.png?width=960&height=163" width=100>)
Use [Discloud](https://discloudbot.com/)! A trust-worthy Discord bot hosting service.

1. Login using your Discord/GitHub account, and then don't close the Dashboard tab (because we need it later).
2. Go to your project on VSCode, create a new file `discloud.config`. This file is a configuration file for Discloud apps servers. The `discloud.config` file content must be like the codeblock below, and remember to change **YOUR_BOT_ID** to your actual bot ID.

```apache
ID = YOUR_BOT_ID
TYPE = bot
MAIN = src/index.js
RAM = 100
AUTORESTART = true
VERSION = latest
API = tools
```

3. Open explorer and navigate using the path of your project. Hold the **CTRL** key, and click on `src/`, `package.json`, and `discloud.config`. Now release the key, and right click on the selected files/folders and click on **Convert into .zip file**.
4. Go back to the Discloud dashboard, click on **Add App**, and then upload the .zip file in the upload box. Make sure to accept the ToS of the service and then click on **Upload**.
5. Wait for at least 20 seconds (depends on your Internet speed), and then your bot should be on.

> **Warning**
> Discloud has recently made every Free plan servers into **15 days** hosting only. Use the command `.rw` from their bot in the commands channel (on their Discord server) to reset the timer. Join the server: [Click here!](https://discord.gg/discloud-584490943034425391)

### Is MongoDB required?
No, MongoDB is not required. There is an option to disable it in `config.js` so you will avoid errors from the commands that requires the database, such as `?prefix`. If you want to use the database, [visit MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/).
